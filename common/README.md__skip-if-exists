It builds all files to dist folder. To deploy to production server, copy all the `dist/*` files to production root folder.

For example
```
dist/index.html
dist/foo.12345.js
```
Copy to production root folder
```
root_folder/index.html
root_folder/foo.12345.js
```
// @endif
// @if dumber
It builds `dist/*-bundle.[hash].js`, updates index.html with hashed js bundle file name. To deploy to production server, copy over both the generated `index.html` and all the `dist/*` files.

For example
```
index.html
dist/entry-bundle.12345.js
```
Copy to production root folder
```
root_folder/index.html
root_folder/dist/entry-bundle.12345.js
```

Unit tests run in browser through [browser-do](https://github.com/3cp/browser-do). Please check scripts in `package.json` for more details.

By default, browser-do shuts down browser after tests. To keep browser window open for inspection, pass additional argument `-k` or `--keep-open`.

    npm run build:test && browser-do -k /* @if jasmine */--jasmine/* @endif *//* @if mocha */--mocha/* @endif *//* @if tape */--tape/* @endif */ --browser chrome < dist/entry-bundle.js
