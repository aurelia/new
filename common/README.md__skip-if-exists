# /* @echo name */

This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia/new](https://github.com/aurelia/new).

## Start dev web server

    npm start

// @if app
## Build the app in production mode

    npm run build

// @if webpack || parcel || fusebox
It builds all files to dist folder. To deploy to production server, copy all the `dist/*` files to production root folder.

For example
```
dist/index.html
dist/foo.12345.js
```
Copy to production root folder
```
root_folder/index.html
root_folder/foo.12345.js
```
// @endif
// @if dumber
It builds `dist/*bundle.[hash].js`, updates index.html with hashed js bundle file name. To deploy to production server, copy over both the generated `index.html` and all the `dist/*` files.

For example
```
index.html
dist/entry.bundle.12345.js
```
Copy to production root folder
```
root_folder/index.html
root_folder/dist/entry.bundle.12345.js
```
// @endif
// @endif
// @if plugin
Note this plugin project comes with a dev-app. The above command starts the dev app in `dev-app/` folder. The plugin source code is in `src/` folder.

## Build the plugin in production modern

    npm run build

It builds plugin into `dist/index.js` file.

Note when you do `npm publish` or `npm pack` to prepare the plugin package, it automatically run the above build command by the `prepare` script defined in your package.json `"scripts"` section.

## Consume the plugin

If your plugin is published to npm or a private registry, just install the plugin package.json

    npm install /* @echo name */

If you want to directly use plugin's git repo.

    npm install git@github.com:username//* @echo name */.git

or

    npm install https://some.git.server/username//* @echo name */.git

If you want to install from local folder, don't do "npm install ../local//* @echo name *//" as the folder's `node_modules/` will cause webpack to complain about duplicated dependency like "@aurelia/metadata".

In this plugin's folder, do

    npm pack

This will pack the plugin into /* @echo name */
In an application project's main file.

```js
import * as myPlugin from '/* @echo name */';
Aurelia
  // Load all exports from the plugin
  .register(myPlugin)
  .app(MyApp)
  .start();
```
// @endif

// @if !no-unit-tests
## Unit Tests

    npm run test

Run unit tests in watch mode.

    npm run test:watch

// @if jasmine || tape || mocha
Unit tests run in browser through [browser-do](https://github.com/3cp/browser-do). Please check scripts in `package.json` for more details.

By default, browser-do shuts down browser after tests. To keep browser window open for inspection, pass additional argument `-k` or `--keep-open`.

    npm run build:test && browser-do -k /* @if jasmine */--jasmine/* @endif *//* @if mocha */--mocha/* @endif *//* @if tape */--tape/* @endif */ --browser chrome < dist/entry.bundle.js
