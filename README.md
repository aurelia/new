# Aurelia 2 Scaffolding skeleton

_Work In Progress_

The scaffolding repo for Aurelia 2 used by the [makes](https://makes.js.org) tool to create new Aurelia 2 projects.

## Create an Aurelia 2 project

There is zero-installation, just do:

```bash
npx makes aureila
```

> Note makes requires Node.js v8.9.0 or above.

## Status

Just basic app with one of bundlers: webpack, parcel, browserify, FuseBox, dumber (successor of CLI built-in bundler).

No unit tests, no e2e tests.

Require verbose decorators on all resources, no support of convention (Aurelia v1 like) yet.
